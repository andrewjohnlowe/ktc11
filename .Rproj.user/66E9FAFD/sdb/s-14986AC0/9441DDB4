Mammalian, reptilian, and piscean taxa were identified using standard zooarchaeological reference manuals (Lekagul and McNeely, 1977; Auetrakulvit, 2004; France, 2009 and Ankel-Simons, 2000). Molluscan taxa were identified using the comparative collections of the National Science Museum of Thailand and additional mollusk references manuals (Swennen et al., 2001; Jiwaluk et al., 2007 and Sucharit and Panha, 2008). The identification processes were hampered by the lack of comparative skeletal material for mammalian, reptilian, and piscean taxa. As such, identification of the former was generally broad based in order to limit identification error and provide a basis for future analysis. Avian taxa were absent from this unit of the KTC assemblage. Number of identified specimen (NISP) counts were used to record the abundance of faunal taxa per stratigraphic unit (Lyman, 2008).\n\nA digital palm scale was used to record the mass of identified elements to the nearest 0.1 gram. Standard inter-landmark dimensions were taken in millimeters, when applicable. In addition, identification of cutmarks and burning were noted for both mollusk and vertebrate remains.  Photographs of complete mollusk specimens were taken using a Canon EOS60D digital camera. All archaeofaunal specimens are deposited at the Department of Archaeology, Silpakorn University, Bangkok, Thailand.   \n\n\n\n## References\n\nVinh, B. (1991).
